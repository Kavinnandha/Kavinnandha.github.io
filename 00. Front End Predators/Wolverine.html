<p style="color:#3d251e;">James "Jimmy" Howlett, also known as Logan or by his codename, The Wolverine (named after the mammal/mustelid), is a fictional character originating as the primary protagonist of 20th Century Fox's X-Men film series, and appearing in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) media franchise produced by Marvel Studios. He is portrayed by Hugh Jackman and based on the Marvel Comics character Wolverine, created by Roy Thomas, Len Wein and John Romita Sr.

Logan has been the central figure of the film series, having appeared in nine films since his introduction in X-Men (2000). The character and Jackman's performance have been credited with helping to cement the series as a multi-billion-dollar franchise, with Logan's appearance often being considered the face of the X-Men.

For his portrayal of Logan, Jackman held the Guinness World Record of the "longest career as a live-action Marvel character," alongside Patrick Stewart,[2] until this was later surpassed by Tobey Maguire and Willem Dafoe who reprised their roles of Peter Parker / Spider-Man and Norman Osborn / Green Goblin from Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy in the MCU film Spider-Man: No Way Home in 2021, though Stewart alone would retake the title later in 2022 following his appearance in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. Jackman is set to return to reprise the role in Deadpool 3 (2024), produced by Marvel Studios and set in the MCU, surpassing Stewart yet again.</p>
<p style="color:yellow;">After the Vietnam War, he becomes a member of a black-ops strike team "Team X", led by Colonel William Stryker. There he protects Victor for killing a superior officer who had tried to stop Victor from killing a villager, before leaving due to the group's disregard for life. However, Howlett's past catches up to him in Canada where he is living under the name "Logan", despite his relationship with Kayla Silverfox, with both the Weapon X project in which he's pitted against Stryker and Creed in 1988, having adamantium grafted to his bones. Taking the name "Wolverine" after the Algonquian spirit Kuekuatsheu, Howlett works together with Creed to fight and kill Weapon XI, after which Stryker shoots Howlett in the brain with adamantium bullets before being arrested. Though he survives, his memory is lost, with his only identifying personal effects being his dog tags.</p>
